# Exploratory Genetic Data Analysis Tool
EGDAT aids users in completing exploratory data analysis on large amounts of gene expression data. Currently, EGDAT supports PCA and t-SNE both independantly and in conjunction. Users can select which datasets they wish to work with and with what dimensionality and the corresponding coordinate and scree plots will display.

PCA + t-SNE yields much more distinguishable clusters!
