# Exploratory Genetic Data Analysis Tool
EGDAT aids users in completing exploratory data analysis on large amounts of gene expression data. Currently, EGDAT supports PCA and t-SNE both independantly and in conjunction. Users can select which datasets they wish to work with and with what dimensionality and the corresponding coordinate and scree plots will display.

You can now overlay K-means clustering over the dimensionality reduction algorithms previously implemented. Look at those pretty little clusters.

PCA + t-SNE yields much more distinguishable clusters! Woah!
