# Exploratory Data Analysis Tool
EDAT aids users in completing exploratory data analysis on large amounts of gene expression data. Currently, EDAT supports PCA  and will soon incorporate t-SNE into the program. Users can select which datasets they wish to work with and with what dimensionality and the corresponding coordinate and scree plots will display.
